# March Madness Predictive Modeling 2020

## Description
This repo contains code to develop a predictive model for the 2020 NCAA March Madness tournament. Included in the repo are scripts to extract tournament and season statistics for NCAA teams from "www.sports-reference.com".

## Repo Contents
1. Scripts
	* *get_season_data.py* - Gets season statistics for teams that appear in NCAA tournament (i.e. Wins, Losses, etc.)
	* *get_tourney_data.py* - Gets data from NCAA tournament games (i.e. Seed, Round, Score, etc.)
	* *data_processor.py* - Processes and cleans up season data. Outputs file to season folder with suffix "\_clean.csv". More details in Data Processing section
2. Data Directories (created during script execution)
	* *data/season/* - directory where all season data is stored
	* *data/tourney/* - directory where all tournament data is stored

## Data Processing
#### Data Checks
1. Print out teams with no associated tournament data or no associated season statistics
	* *Performed separately on each year of data*
	* *Some teams have season stats but are missing tournament matchup data*
	* *There should not be any teams with tourney matchup data but no season statistics*

#### Data Cleaning
1. Map team names in season data to abbreviated versions used in tourney data
	* *Abbreviation mappings stored and editable in "helper/school\_abbrevs.py"*
